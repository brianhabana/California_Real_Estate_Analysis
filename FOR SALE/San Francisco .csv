Met by an elegant and inviting living room with a big bay window, 340's layout separates its bedrooms for a bit more privacy with one overlooking the lush back garden, which is just outside a combined kitchen/dining area. 340's kitchen updates include a new island gas cooktop, new stainless sink + faucet and, like the rest of 340, new functional + dramatic LED lighting. The kitchen also has a dishwasher, French-door refrigerator + full pantry. Despite its close proximity to so much, e.g., Dolores + Duboce Parks, the block still has a vibe of a neighborly sanctuary.

A quintessential home on a quintessential Nob Hill block, this one is sweet, petite, and perfectly priced. First timers can get a toehold on the market here, and it's also ideal for pied--terre owners who would rather sleep in town than drive back home. The numbers even work for an investor; 30-day short term rentals are possible and the home last garnered $2800 per month. Positioned on the first floor, the windows sit well above a tree-lined street with markets nearby that sell fresh flowers and perfectly prepared foods. A well-equipped kitchen makes cooking at home a reality, and there's even room for a table and chairs. And you can even visit with friends when you take the elevator up to dine al fresco on a roof deck full of fresh air and spectacular views.","https://www.redfin.com/city/17151/CA/San-Francisco/filter/sort=lo-price,property-type=house+condo+townhouse+multifamily+manufactured,include=mlsfsbo+foreclosed+sold-3mo","https://www.redfin.com/CA/San-Francisco/1155-Leavenworth-St-94109/unit-2/home/102819850","https://www.redfin.com/city/17151/CA/San-Francisco/filter/sort=lo-price,property-type=house+condo+townhouse+multifamily+manufactured,include=mlsfsbo+foreclosed+sold-3mo"
