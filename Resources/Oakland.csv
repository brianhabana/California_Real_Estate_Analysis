Tucked in a cul-de-sac, the peace & quiet on Silverado court is savored by neighbors; it's like a secret no one wants to let out! All level, your mid-century rancher may be one for the long-term. Once one moves here, often it's for good as there's so much to offer like the hiking trails of Knowland park & the upcoming amenities of the Oak Knoll community nearby. Warm & inviting, one's first impression upon entry are the classic characteristic exposed beams in the living room with vaulted ceilings that speak to an era of exemplary architecture. Still offering plenty of opportunity for your own tastes to shine, here’s your palette to paint the life you’ve been yearning for.","https://www.redfin.com/city/13654/CA/Oakland/filter/sort=lo-price,property-type=house+condo+townhouse+multifamily+manufactured,include=mlsfsbo+foreclosed+sold-3mo,viewport=38.74419:37.07354:-120.67884:-123.98848","https://www.redfin.com/CA/Oakland/268-Silverado-Ct-94605/home/1268641","https://www.redfin.com/city/13654/CA/Oakland/filter/sort=lo-price,property-type=house+condo+townhouse+multifamily+manufactured,include=mlsfsbo+foreclosed+sold-3mo,viewport=38.74419:37.07354:-120.67884:-123.98848/page-7"

Look no further. Your dream home is a perfect mix of farm-to-table and custom design. Formerly the Oakland Concord Missionary Baptist Church, it was transformed into a family home blessed by the family who had been there for generations. The sellers repaired, redesigned, and reinvented with many creative details. The big backyard became the perfect spot for growing their own veggies, gathering fresh eggs and enjoying meals on the back deck. The Mom is a teacher, artist and chef, the Dad a renowned artist specializing in furniture, sculpture and home accessories. He redesigned their newly acquired home, transforming this historical residence to a beautifully integrated 3-bedroom, 1.5 bath home with all built-ins designed and made by him with quality of materials, craftsmanship and rustic charm.
